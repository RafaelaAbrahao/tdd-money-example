# Money Example â€“ TDD in Java

This repository contains my implementation of the Money Example from Kent Beck's book Test-Driven 
Development: By Example. This project is my attempt to follow the book in order to practice and 
solidify my understanding of Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Java. The project demonstrates TDD 
principles by incrementally building a simple currency conversion system, step by step.
